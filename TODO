besides the stuff mentioned in comments throughout the code,
a few things would be nice to have or somewhat important:
- authentication
- dump <- input-hash association signatures (realizations)
- containerization using crun.
  - setup a chroot
  - and copy the necessary files inside
- reattaching to logs
  (partially done because we can now attach multiple loggers)
- auto-repair of broken store entries
- build server cluster support (distcc-like)
- maybe parse ninja files, and the split compile-build-rules
  into two to run preprocessing in a separate step
  (this approach is similar to what distcc uses to decouple from input)
- proper cancellation of builds
