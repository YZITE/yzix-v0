besides the stuff mentioned in comments throughout the code,
a few things would be nice to have or somewhat important:
- dump <- input-hash association signatures (realizations)
- maybe more restricted containerization?
- build server cluster support (distcc-like)
- maybe parse ninja files, and the split compile-build-rules
  into two to run preprocessing in a separate step
  (this approach is similar to what distcc uses to decouple from input)
- proper cancellation of builds
- proper dump verification and repair (start repair as soon as detecting corruption)
